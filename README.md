# Data-Analyst-Nanodegree
The repository contains all the eight (8) required projects completed during Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
1. [Explore Weather Trends](https://github.com/Iamigoche/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/Explore%20Weather%20Trends)
> This project required that students analyze local and global temperature data and compare the the temperature trends of where they live to over all global temperature trends.

2. [Explore US Bikeshare Data](https://github.com/Iamigoche/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/Explore%20US%20Bikeshare%20Data)
> In this project, students are required to make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. I performed data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. Data visualizations were made with packages that are not part of the standard Python library.

3. [Investigate a Dataset](https://github.com/Iamigoche/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/Investigate%20a%20dataset)
> **I learned to:**
- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

4. [Analyze AB Test Results](https://github.com/Iamigoche/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/Analyze%20AB%20Test%20Result)
> This project involves working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

5. [Test a Perceptual Phenomenon](https://github.com/Iamigoche/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/Test%20a%20Perception%20Phenimenon)
> **I learned to:**
- How to identify components of an experiment.
- How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample.
- How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results.

6. [Prosper Loan Exploratory Data Analysis With R](https://github.com/Iamigoche/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/prosper_Loan_EDA_with_r)
> In this project, R was used to apply exploratory data analysis techniques in a selected dataset to discover relationships among multiple variables, and create explanatory visualizations illuminating distributions, outliers, and anomalies.
> **I learned to:**
- Understand the distribution of a variable and to check for anomalies and outliers
- Learn how to quantify and visualize individual variables within a data set by using appropriate plots such as scatter plots, histograms, bar charts, and box plots
- Explore variables to identify the most important variables and relationships within a data set before building predictive models; calculate correlations, and investigate conditional means
- Learn powerful methods and visualizations for examining relationships among multiple variables, such as reshaping data frames and using aesthetics like color and shape to uncover more information

7. [Data Wrangling WIth Python - WeRateDogs](https://github.com/Iamigoche/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/Data%20Wrangling%20-%20WeRateDogs)
> The dataset wrangled (and analyzed and visualized) in this project is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. It involves,
- Gathering data
- Assessing data
- Cleaning data
- Storing, analyzing, and visualizing your wrangled data
- Reporting on 1) data wrangling efforts and 2) data analyses and visualizations

8. [Prosper Loans - Story Telling With Tableau](https://github.com/Iamigoche/Data-Analyst-Nanodegree/tree/master/Prosper%20loans%20-%20story%20telling%20with%20tableau)
> I learned to:
- Demonstrate the ability to choose optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of a visualization
- Communicate a story or finding to the appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
- Undergo the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with Tableau
